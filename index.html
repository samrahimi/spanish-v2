                    The Fast And Fun Language program is an accelerated Spanish program which enables students to learn the equivalent of 1-2 years of high school Spanish in only 8 weeks. After completing an 8 week class, students receive a World language credit certificate that counts as a years worth of daily classroom Spanish. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    There are three levels of the program, each of which follows the same format: each week, students will attend a live zoom class, a pre-recorded zoom class, and take part in an interactive learning activity - a total of 24 classes over the 8-week period. All classes are conducted IN Spanish - not ABOUT Spanish - creating an immersive environment that accelerates learning and builds real-world speaking abilities.

I love using the best Accelerated Learning techniques in the world to help kids learn to speak Spanish in a fraction of the time of conventional online and classroom programsâ€¦and have enormous fun doing it.

                    Hello, I'm Reed Goodey. Let's get the Boring stuff out the way firstâ€¦I am a credentialed teacher in multiple states, and have over 30 years experience as a teacher, including Homeschooling my own kids. I have Degrees in French and Spanish Literature  and a Masters Degree in Education. I have taught all levels of Spanish and French, including AP and International Baccalaureate. I have studied and lived abroad in many countries, and I also speak Italian. I have traveled extensively throughout, Europe, Northern Africa, China, The Middle East, Mexico, and Central and South America.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
                    First of all, I believe learning should be fun, and that belief has been substantiated in over 30 years of experience. In those years, I've seen thousands of students learn languages more than 10 times faster when they are having fun. The next most important thing that accelerates the learning of any language is to be in the most optimal state for learning. The optimal state for accelerated learning for any language is curiosity.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
                    This is why, in all my classes, I maintain a constant atmosphere of playfulness, humor, curiosity, and fun. I have a lot in common with John Taylor Gatto, who spent his life teaching in the public school system, but was totally against the system because of the dysfunctional way it indoctrinated kids, rather than educated them.  I have worked in private and public schools for years, teaching as much as possible in a life-giving way, yet I have recently left that system, as the system is much too broken to continue.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
                    I have been working with homeschoolers for years, and I homeschooled my own children some of the time in order to provide as much love of learning and curiosity as possible to them. I have a very Charlotte Mason approach and embrace her philosophy of learning in a big way. I teach in Spanish, not about Spanish in my classes, and culture, and all types of subjects are discussed in my classes, and students are about to use the language to express themselves, versus merely learning to do well on a quiz or test.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
                    I believe learning should be engaging and fun, so I use lots of movement, props, jokes, co-created stories and more. I also know that teaching the most frequently used words and phrases gets one understanding and speaking quickly, so that one can express opinions, ask questions, and be able to use the language when traveling.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
                    I also know that it's important to feel at ease when learning, so that's why I create an atmosphere where the students all know each other and interests, and feel safe when taking risks in expressing themselves in another language. Each class is a small community and most continue on into the higher levels as a group.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
                    I get to know all my students and caring and connection are weaved into every part of my classes. I look forward to getting to know you, and your child and exploring this life-giving adventure of learning a language together that opens so many doors and possibilities in one's life! I hope to see you in the next class!
                </p>
